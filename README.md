GitHub Allows you to easily control versions of a project and work simultaneously on different parts of a project then merge changes. A commit is an update to the project. Branches are different states of the project that exist simultaneously. The master branch is the current state of the project. You should NEVER commit a change directly to master. When you make a significant change and everything works correctly, commit that change to a new branch under either the Game Structure or Entities branch depending on which side you are working on. Make sure to leave detailed commit notes. You can later merge that branch to master to update it with your changes.

You should create your own personal branch from either game entities or game structure depending on which side of the project you are working on. You will only commit to that branch.

To get started, fork the repository (upper right hand corner) and clone it locally.
